# Mocked-client

This repository contains projects used as a mock environment for testing or implementation of features not yet ready for the actual system. 
It contains both a mocked native android app client and a mocked web client. 

Language used is Java for both clients to make the transition into real system eaasier. 

The issues allow for implementation of features in a organized way. To resolve an issue, the PR comment must contain "Resolves #issueNumber". A PR comment could also contain "Connected to #issueNumber", which tells that the PR is related to that issue, but does not resolve it. 

Owners are Fanny SÃ¶derlund, Malek Alabed, Nishat Jahan, Suzanne Zomer, Ismail Eyamba
